# Flowdesk Cumulative Delta

# Overview

As a market maker, having an index that indicates our current cumulative delta on a specific trading pair is essential. Itâ€™s used by risk management to evaluate our current position and if we need to take some actions. To achieve this, we consume trades to calculate the cumulative delta.

This is a REST API that provides the cumulative delta of a specific trading pair by fetching the public trades history for a specific pair on the Kucoin exchange and computing the cumulative delta index from the historical trades and return it.
